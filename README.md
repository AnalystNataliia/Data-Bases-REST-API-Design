**Access Control System (ACS): Smart Barriers**

For the underground paid parking of the shopping center, it is necessary to develop an ACS that will allow:

1. To capture vehicle license plates at the entrance and exit.
2. To issue parking tickets only in case of inability to read the license plate.
3. To automatically open the parking account upon the vehicle's entry. Parking is charged hourly. The first 15 minutes are free. Exit after payment is possible within 15 minutes.
4. To pay the parking account through the parking machine and mobile application.
